                    <p> The Berkeley Chapter of Kappa Alpha Pi was created out of the desire to uphold values that are at the core of its existence and function. We vow to uphold the values of integrity, compassion and professional competence in all our decision-making processes to advance the ideals of social justice and liberty under the law. Our fraternity will exercise these values internally, as our members pursue moral, intellectual and professional advancement, and externally as we forge bonds in the local and campus communities. Though we hold our members to the utmost level of excellence, we do not tolerate hazing, intimidation or harassment of our members at anytime. We pride ourselves on an extremely high standard of development and growth, both in the Leadership Development semester and beyond. Furthermore, we share a common passion for social justice and offer members continuous opportunities to grow as well-rounded, successful leaders. At our core, we value and respect each other and foster close-knit bonds between our brothers and sisters. We would love to meet all interested applicants and we encourage you to attend our recruitment events to see if you are a good fit for our unique community.

                    <h3 class="section-header">Are all recruitment events mandatory?</h3>
                    <p> Attending the Recruitment events is not mandatory, however, it is strongly recommended because these events are geared to introduce potential applicants to our members and fraternity. This is designed to give potential applicants valuable information, opportunity ask questions, and interact with our members. The more events that you attend the more likely that you will make a positive and valuable impression, which can only help your chances of selected to join our fraternity.

                    <p> That is perfectly fine, KAPi is geared towards leadership development and professional development, which will be invaluable regardless of the professional career you choose. Our fraternity will also expose you to the legal field through our ambitious and legal oriented members and through the Leadership Development Program. Hopefully by the end of the leadership development semester and after interactions with our members, you will have a better idea of whether or not you wish to pursue a career in the legal field. If you decide law is not for you, that is also not a problem. Our membership is compried of a diverse community of intelligent individuals interested in a wide range of professional careers which include: business, engineering, the environment and social justice, and a variety of other non-legal professions.

                    <p> The Leadership Development semester is our rigorous 10-week program tasked with developing your leadership skills, public speaking skills, time-management skills, debate skills, and professionalism. The program also serves to develop strong bonds with other newly-admitted members and exposing you to the legal profession and other professional careers. In addition to weekly meetings and professional and fraternal assignments, you will be required to fundraise, host events, attend fraternity events, participate in the planning and public relations efforts of our organization, and much more. The time required of this program is roughly equated to another 4-unit class here on campus with an estimated minimum of 20-25 hours a week. Although challenging, this semester is invaluable for developing the skills required for a successful professional career.
