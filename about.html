                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">On October 8th, 2007, Kappa Alpha Pi was started by a united group of likeminded undergraduate pre-law students at the University of Michigan. Formerly associated with the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity International, these high-achieving students disaffiliated in favor of the safety of its members and their close-knit community. Kappa Alpha Pi now consists of over 7 dynamic and respected chapters at institutions of higher learning all across the nation.</p>
                    <h2>UC Berkeley's Iota Chapter </h2>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                        Throughout the Spring semester of 2014, members of the UC Berkeley Chapter of Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity International faced concerns with the structure and governance of their fraternity. To preserve the values and to maintain the best interests of its membership, a majority of our chapter membership elected to disaffiliate from Phi Alpha Delta and reconstitute as the first UC Berkeley Chapter of Kappa Alpha Pi Pre-Law, Co-Ed Fraternity. With that, the UC Berkeley Chapter of Kappa Alpha Pi was created out of the desire to uphold values that are at the core of its existence and function. We vow to uphold integrity, compassion and professional competence in all our decision-making processes in order to advance the ideals of social justice and liberty under the law. Our fraternity will exercise these values internally, as our members pursue moral, intellectual and professional advancement, and externally as we forge bonds local and on-campus communities.</p>
                    <h2>Our Purpose </h2>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">The purpose of this fraternity shall be to foster knowledge of the law for undergraduate students; to provide service to the greater community and campus; to promote a strong sense of fraternalism among members; to uphold the ideals and integrity of Kappa Alpha Pi Pre-Law Co-Ed Fraternity; so that each member may advance his or her intellect while contributing actively to the well-being of others.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">The UC Berkeley Chapter of Kappa Alpha Pi, Co-Ed Pre-Law Fraternity, was founded by a high-achieving, diverse group of students who disaffiliated from Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law International Fraternity out of the desire to uphold our values that are now at the core of Kappa Alpha Pi’s existence and function. These values that we hold most dear, and which guide our decision-making processes are integrity, compassion, professional competence, and a desire to advance the ideals of social justice and liberty under the law.
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Coming to Cal from a variety of backgrounds, KAPi’s members are accomplished individuals united by a strong sense of fraternalism and a collective interest in the legal field. By pursuing interests that span disciplines and communities, our well-rounded members form a deep network throughout the Bay Area and beyond. Joining this close-knit and dynamic group provides students with a community of individuals who strive to be an invaluable resource for each other in every sense &#8212 a strongly bonded support system, an ever-growing network, and a hub of unrivaled professional and social leadership development.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">In pursuit of our motto: “Honoring those who paved the path before us, steadfastly serving those around us, and making progress for those to come” we offer our students unparalleled leadership development that begins with our ten-week, intensive Leadership Development Program. Going beyond the average resume and cover letter workshop, this program provides students with one-on-one mentorship, which students emerge from with a polished toolkit to succeed in the professional world. The syllabus includes lessons on public speaking, networking, attorney shadowing, career planning, case briefs, time management, law school preparation, and more. Students will gain access to our extensive network that includes students at top graduate and law schools, professionals throughout the nation, Dean Tom of Berkeley Law, and special discounts at test preparation companies.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Beyond the Leadership Development Program, students are able to create and plan philanthropic endeavors, utilize our networks to host legal events, work with attorneys to put on our annual pro-bono legal clinic, and gain one-on-one attention during workshops with professionals in the Bay Area on topics such as strategic planning and career development. Berkeley Kappa Alpha Pi constantly strives to provide its membership with unrivaled development through its social justice minded community of passionate and talented students. By investing in KAPi, members cultivate their personal strengths by simultaneously learning from their exceptional peers. If you are interested in the legal field, and are looking to create life-long relationships with like-minded individuals, consider joining Kappa Alpha Pi; you will find that this community offers challenging and enriching professional and personal experiences. Thank you for your interest in our fraternity, and I look forward to sharing with you the uniquely rewarding aspects of becoming a member of Kappa Alpha Pi.</p>
